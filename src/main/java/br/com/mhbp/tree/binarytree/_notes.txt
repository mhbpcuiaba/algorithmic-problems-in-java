A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

A perfect binary tree is a full binary i which all leaves are at the same depth, and in which
every parent has two children.

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibily the last,
is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

A perfect binary tree of height h contains exactly 2 ^ (h + 1) nodes, of which 2 ^h are leaves.

A complete binary tree on n nodes has  height log n.

A left-skewed tree is a tree in which no node has a right child.
A right-skewed tree is a tree in which no node has a left child.
In either case, we refer to binary tree as being skewed.

A key computation on a binary tree is traversing.

there are 3 types of traversing:
    inorder (left, value, right)
    preorder (value, left, right)
    inorder (right, left, value)
