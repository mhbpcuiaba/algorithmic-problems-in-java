heap supports O(log n) fro insertion,
O(1) for max/min element
O(log n) for deletion
O(n) to search for an arbitrary key

A heap is sometimes referred to as a priority queue cause it behaves like a queue,
with one difference: each element has a "priority" associated with it,
and deletion removes the element with highest priority.


the PriorityQueue key methods are add("hi"), peek(), poll(), the latter two returning null when the heap is empty.
It is possible to specify a custom comparator in the heap constructor.
