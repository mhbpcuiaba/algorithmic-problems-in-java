FIFO vs LIFO

parses typically benefits from a stack.
stacks support last-in, first-out semantics for inserts and deletes,
whereas queues are first-in, first-out.

stacks and queues are usually building blocks in a  solution to a complex problem

stacks support push and pop.

When the stack is implemented using a linked list these operations have O(1) time complexity.
If it is implemented using an array, there is maximum number of entries it can have-
push and pop are still O(1).

If the array is dynamically resized, the amortized time for both push and pop is O(1).

A stack can support additional operations such as peek, which returns the top of the stack without popping it.

first-out semantics of a stack make it very useful for creating reverse iterators for sequences
which are stored in a way that would make it difficult or impossible to step back from a given element.


Returning null + removing operations: poll() docs

Throwing exception + removing operations: pop()docs

the preferred way to represent stacks in Java is via the Deque interface.

The ArrayDeque class is a resizable array that implements this interface,
and  provides O(1) time stack (and queue) functionality.

It is efficient, and its use is considered as a best practice.

The key stack-related methods in the Deque interface are push(42), peek(), and pop().

The Deque methods addFirst(42), peekFirst(42), peekFirst() and removeFirst()
are identical to push(42), peek(), and pop().

* push(e)
    throw an IllegalStateException if the capacity limit us exceed, or a NullPointerException
    if the element being inserted is null.

    LinkedList has no capacity limit and allows for null entries.

* peek()


* pop()


A queue supports two basic operations -- enqueue and dequeue. if you try to remove
an element form empty queue you will either get null or exception.

first-in, first-out
A queue can be implemented using a linked list or array

A deque, also sometimes called a double-ended queue, is a doubly linked list
in which all insertions to the front is commonly called a push, and an insertion
to the back is commonly called inject.

A deletion from the front is commonly called a pop, and a deletion from the back is
commonly called an eject.

queues are ideal when order needs to be preserved

The preferred way to manipulate queues is via the Deque interface.
