The key methods on strings are charAt(1), compareTo("foo"), concat("bar"), contains("aba", endsWith("Xy"),
indexOf("needle"), indexOf("needle",12), indexOf('A'), indexOf('B', offset), lastIndexOf("needle"), length(),
replace('a', 'A'), replace("a", "A"); "a;d;f".split(";"), startsWith, substring, toCharArray, toLowerCase, toUpperCase

    The substring() method is particularly important, and also easy t oget wrong,
    since it has two variants: one takes a start and end index
    ( the returned substring includes the character at start but not the character at end).

The methods in StringBuilder are append(), charAt(), delete(), deleteCharAt(), insert, replace and toString
