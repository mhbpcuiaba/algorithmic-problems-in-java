Principle of Secure Coding

    cohesion, specific function for specific needs to disambiguate

    * Make interfaces simple even when for internal use only.
    * Give useful error messages, and describe the error precisely
        - For those caused by internal inconsistencies, name the routine to help'whoever debugs it
        - In general, it's better to report the error to the caller, giving enough information so
          the caller can decide how to handle the error.
    * Pure function
        - no side effects to the parameters(whenever is possible)
    * CHeck functions parameters refers to a valid data structure
